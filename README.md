# Cats Twitter

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use RPC+Protobuf with TypeScript. I have no experience with TypeScript, so I would like to learn it. As database I choose SQLite, because it is easy to use and removes pain with database management. As RPC framework I chose Twirp, because it allows to use browser.
